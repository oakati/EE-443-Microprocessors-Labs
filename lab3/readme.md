This program mainly conducts two tasks.

1. It bubble-sorts three arrays of signed numbers of different sizes stored in different memory locations sequentially from smallest element to the biggest element. It is different from Lab 2 in the sense that it utilizes subroutines for doing this.
2. This part uses delay subroutines to turn on one LED at a time, and makes this turn on LED walk from left to right and right to left within a specified time interval.
